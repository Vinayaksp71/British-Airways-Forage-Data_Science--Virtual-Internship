Welcome to the British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship! This repository contains the project 
files and resources for the British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship offered through Forage.

Internship Description
The British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship provides an opportunity to work on real-world 
data science projects in collaboration with British Airways. As an intern, you will gain practical 
experience in solving data science problems and applying machine learning techniques to airlinerelated datasets.
Throughout the internship, you will work on various tasks, such as data cleaning and preprocessing, 
exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development and evaluation, and more. The 
internship is designed to help you develop your data science skills and gain insights into the airline 
industry.
